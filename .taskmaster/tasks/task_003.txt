# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop DirectorAgent and Task Router
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the DirectorAgent with routing logic to dispatch tasks to appropriate department agents based on intent classification.
# Details:
1. Create DirectorAgent class in agents/director.py
2. Implement keyword-based intent classifier for routing tasks
3. Add LLM-based routing as an alternative classification method
4. Create Flask route at /task that accepts JSON payloads
5. Implement request validation for type and args fields
6. Add task logging to SQLite database
7. Create routing logic to dispatch to department agents
8. Implement error handling and response formatting
9. Add support for task status tracking
10. Create utility functions for common director operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test intent classifier with various input types
2. Test routing logic with mock department agents
3. Verify correct HTTP responses for valid and invalid requests
4. Validate database logging of tasks
5. Test error handling for edge cases
6. Benchmark routing performance under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Core Director Agent Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the foundational Director Agent architecture with hierarchical control structures and decision-making capabilities
### Details:
Create the base Director Agent class with supervisor capabilities for task decomposition and delegation. Implement the core decision-making cycle that evaluates evidence, updates beliefs, and selects actions to maximize utility. Include the structured utility network with preference nodes for narrative/task objectives. Establish the monitoring system for tracking subtask progress and agent state.

## 2. Build Intent Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop both keyword-based and LLM-based classification systems for accurately determining user intent
### Details:
Implement a dual-layer intent classification system combining keyword matching for efficiency and LLM-based classification for nuanced understanding. Create training datasets for intent categories. Develop confidence scoring mechanisms to determine when to escalate from keyword to LLM classification. Include feedback loops for continuous improvement of classification accuracy based on interaction outcomes.

## 3. Implement Routing Logic and Agent Communication [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create the routing framework that directs tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on intent classification
### Details:
Develop the routing decision tree that maps classified intents to specific agent capabilities. Implement the inter-agent communication protocol for standardized messaging. Create the parallel execution framework allowing multiple specialist agents to work simultaneously. Build the aggregation system for synthesizing results from multiple agents. Include error handling and fallback mechanisms for routing failures.

## 4. Develop API Integration and External Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create HTTP endpoints and integration points for the Director Agent to communicate with external systems
### Details:
Implement RESTful API endpoints for receiving requests and returning responses. Create authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure API access. Develop serialization/deserialization utilities for structured data exchange. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for API interactions. Build monitoring interfaces to track system performance and agent activities. Create documentation for API usage and integration patterns.
