# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement AutoGen Integration Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Microsoft's AutoGen framework integration for agent orchestration and multi-agent chains.
# Details:
1. Create AutoGen integration module in utils/autogen_integration.py
2. Implement base classes for AutoGen agent types:
   - BaseAutoGenAgent
   - AutoGenChatAgent
   - AutoGenToolAgent
3. Set up configuration for AutoGen agents
4. Implement MultiAgentChain utility for parallel agent execution
5. Create agent factory pattern for dynamic agent instantiation
6. Add support for AutoGen streaming capabilities
7. Implement agent conversation history tracking
8. Create utility functions for agent message formatting

# Test Strategy:
1. Test AutoGen agent initialization with various configurations
2. Verify MultiAgentChain correctly executes parallel tasks
3. Test streaming functionality with mock agents
4. Validate conversation history tracking
5. Benchmark agent performance under different loads
6. Test error handling during agent communication

# Subtasks:
## 1. Base Framework Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the AutoGen framework with necessary dependencies and environment setup
### Details:
Install AutoGen using pip, set up API keys for language models, configure environment variables, and establish the basic project structure. Include initialization of the core components like API layer and processing engine as mentioned in the architecture overview.

Implementation Analysis & Plan for Base Framework Setup:

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
- AutoGen (pyautogen==0.1.14) is already installed in requirements.txt
- Virtual environment is set up and AutoGen imports successfully (import autogen)
- Basic autogen_helpers.py already exists in utils/ with helper functions
- Available AutoGen classes: AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager, etc.

DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Enhanced autogen_integration.py module in utils/:
   - BaseAutoGenAgent class: abstract base for all AutoGen agents
   - AutoGenChatAgent class: wrapper for AssistantAgent with enhanced features
   - AutoGenToolAgent class: specialized agent for tool use
   - MultiAgentChain class: orchestrator for parallel agent execution
   - Configuration management and validation
   - Factory pattern for dynamic agent creation

2. Key files to create/modify:
   - utils/autogen_integration.py (new main module)
   - Enhance existing utils/autogen_helpers.py (keep compatibility)
   - Add configuration classes for different agent types
   - Add streaming support and conversation tracking

3. Integration architecture:
   - Base classes extending AutoGen's core functionality
   - Factory pattern for dynamic agent instantiation
   - Configuration system for different deployment scenarios
   - Streaming capabilities for real-time agent communication
   - Conversation history and analytics tracking

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

All core components of the AutoGen integration framework have been implemented and validated. The project now includes a robust agent abstraction layer, dynamic agent factory, multi-agent orchestration, streaming support, and a flexible configuration system supporting multiple AI providers. Backward compatibility with legacy helpers is maintained, and comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability. The workspace is fully set up for further development.

Ready for transition to specialized agent role implementations (Subtask 4.2), advanced multi-agent orchestration (4.3), and analytics/conversation tracking (4.4).

## 2. Agent Type Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop different types of agents required for the application
### Details:
Create specialized agents with defined roles, capabilities, and behaviors. Implement assistant agents, user proxy agents, and any custom agents needed for the specific use case. Configure each agent with appropriate language model settings and response handling mechanisms.

## 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement GroupChat or GroupChatManager for coordinating dialogue flow between agents
### Details:
Set up the GroupChat component to manage message passing between agents. Configure the orchestration logic to determine which agent responds when, implement conversation flow control, and establish agent interaction patterns for solving complex tasks collaboratively.

## 4. Conversation Tracking Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms to track, store, and analyze agent conversations
### Details:
Implement data storage solutions for conversation history, create logging mechanisms for agent interactions, develop analytics capabilities to evaluate conversation effectiveness, and build interfaces to visualize conversation flows and agent performance metrics.
