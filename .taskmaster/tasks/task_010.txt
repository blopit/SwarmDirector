# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement AutoGen Streaming Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the streaming agent interface for real-time feedback using AutoGen's streaming capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create streaming module in utils/streaming.py
2. Implement AutoGen streaming configuration
3. Create WebSocket endpoint for streaming connections
4. Implement streaming agent wrapper
5. Add token buffering mechanism
6. Create client-side event handling
7. Implement reconnection logic
8. Add streaming performance monitoring
9. Create utility functions for stream management
10. Implement error handling for stream interruptions

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streaming with mock agents
2. Verify token delivery without loss
3. Test reconnection scenarios
4. Validate performance under various network conditions
5. Benchmark streaming latency
6. Test concurrent streaming connections

# Subtasks:
## 1. AutoGen Streaming Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up AutoGen to support streaming responses through WebSockets
### Details:
Configure AutoGen to buffer and stream tokens incrementally. Implement backpressure handling to control data flow rates. Set up proper error handling and connection management for reliable streaming performance.

âœ… AutoGen Streaming Configuration Implementation Completed

Implementation Summary:
- Developed a comprehensive streaming utility module at src/swarm_director/utils/streaming.py (449 lines)
- Implemented token buffering with configurable backpressure handling
- Added streaming session management with robust state tracking
- Built an AutoGen response adapter for converting responses to streaming tokens
- Included a streaming manager for handling multiple concurrent sessions

Key Components Implemented:

1. StreamingConfig - Configuration dataclass supporting:
   - Buffer size (default: 1000 tokens)
   - Max tokens per second rate limiting (default: 50)
   - Backpressure thresholds (pause at 80%, resume at 30%)
   - Timeout and heartbeat settings

2. TokenBuffer - Thread-safe buffer featuring:
   - Async put/get operations with proper locking
   - Backpressure detection and control
   - Chunk-based token retrieval
   - Metrics tracking (peak buffer size, etc.)

3. StreamingSession - Session management with:
   - Producer/consumer pattern for token streaming
   - Client handler management for WebSocket connections
   - State management (IDLE, STREAMING, PAUSED, ERROR, CLOSED)
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Comprehensive metrics collection

4. AutoGenStreamingAdapter - Converts AutoGen responses to streaming tokens:
   - Word-by-word streaming from text responses
   - Support for AutoGen chat history format
   - Configurable streaming delays

5. StreamingManager - Global session management:
   - Session creation with auto-generated IDs
   - Session cleanup and timeout handling
   - Status monitoring for all active sessions

Technical Features:
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Backpressure handling to prevent memory issues
- Rate limiting to control streaming speed
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Thread-safe operations with asyncio locks

Testing:
- All existing tests continue to pass (237 passed)
- Streaming module imports and basic functionality verified
- Ready for integration with WebSocket endpoints

Next Steps:
- WebSocket endpoint implementation (next subtask)
- Client-side JavaScript integration
- Performance optimization based on real-world usage

## 2. WebSocket Endpoint Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create server-side WebSocket endpoints for bi-directional communication
### Details:
Develop asynchronous WebSocket server endpoints using WebSocketStream API. Implement connection lifecycle management (open, message, close, error). Set up proper authentication and security measures for WebSocket connections.

## 3. Client-Side Event Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement browser-side code to process streamed responses
### Details:
Create client-side WebSocketStream implementation to connect to endpoints. Develop event handlers for receiving and processing streamed tokens. Implement UI components to display streaming responses with proper rendering and updates.
