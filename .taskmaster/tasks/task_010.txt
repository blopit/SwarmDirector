# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement AutoGen Streaming Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the streaming agent interface for real-time feedback using AutoGen's streaming capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create streaming module in utils/streaming.py
2. Implement AutoGen streaming configuration
3. Create WebSocket endpoint for streaming connections
4. Implement streaming agent wrapper
5. Add token buffering mechanism
6. Create client-side event handling
7. Implement reconnection logic
8. Add streaming performance monitoring
9. Create utility functions for stream management
10. Implement error handling for stream interruptions

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streaming with mock agents
2. Verify token delivery without loss
3. Test reconnection scenarios
4. Validate performance under various network conditions
5. Benchmark streaming latency
6. Test concurrent streaming connections

# Subtasks:
## 1. AutoGen Streaming Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up AutoGen to support streaming responses through WebSockets
### Details:
Configure AutoGen to buffer and stream tokens incrementally. Implement backpressure handling to control data flow rates. Set up proper error handling and connection management for reliable streaming performance.

## 2. WebSocket Endpoint Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create server-side WebSocket endpoints for bi-directional communication
### Details:
Develop asynchronous WebSocket server endpoints using WebSocketStream API. Implement connection lifecycle management (open, message, close, error). Set up proper authentication and security measures for WebSocket connections.

## 3. Client-Side Event Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement browser-side code to process streamed responses
### Details:
Create client-side WebSocketStream implementation to connect to endpoints. Develop event handlers for receiving and processing streamed tokens. Implement UI components to display streaming responses with proper rendering and updates.
