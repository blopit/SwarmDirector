✅ AutoGen Streaming Configuration Implementation Completed

Implementation Summary:
- Developed a comprehensive streaming utility module at src/swarm_director/utils/streaming.py (449 lines)
- Implemented token buffering with configurable backpressure handling
- Added streaming session management with robust state tracking
- Built an AutoGen response adapter for converting responses to streaming tokens
- Included a streaming manager for handling multiple concurrent sessions

Key Components Implemented:

1. StreamingConfig - Configuration dataclass supporting:
   - Buffer size (default: 1000 tokens)
   - Max tokens per second rate limiting (default: 50)
   - Backpressure thresholds (pause at 80%, resume at 30%)
   - Timeout and heartbeat settings

2. TokenBuffer - Thread-safe buffer featuring:
   - Async put/get operations with proper locking
   - Backpressure detection and control
   - Chunk-based token retrieval
   - Metrics tracking (peak buffer size, etc.)

3. StreamingSession - Session management with:
   - Producer/consumer pattern for token streaming
   - Client handler management for WebSocket connections
   - State management (IDLE, STREAMING, PAUSED, ERROR, CLOSED)
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Comprehensive metrics collection

4. AutoGenStreamingAdapter - Converts AutoGen responses to streaming tokens:
   - Word-by-word streaming from text responses
   - Support for AutoGen chat history format
   - Configurable streaming delays

5. StreamingManager - Global session management:
   - Session creation with auto-generated IDs
   - Session cleanup and timeout handling
   - Status monitoring for all active sessions

Technical Features:
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Backpressure handling to prevent memory issues
- Rate limiting to control streaming speed
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Thread-safe operations with asyncio locks

Testing:
- All existing tests continue to pass (237 passed)
- Streaming module imports and basic functionality verified
- Ready for integration with WebSocket endpoints

Next Steps:
- WebSocket endpoint implementation (next subtask)
- Client-side JavaScript integration
- Performance optimization based on real-world usage

## 2. WebSocket Endpoint Development [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create server-side WebSocket endpoints for bi-directional communication
### Details:
Develop asynchronous WebSocket server endpoints using WebSocketStream API. Implement connection lifecycle management (open, message, close, error). Set up proper authentication and security measures for WebSocket connections.

✅ **WebSocket Endpoint Development - COMPLETED**

**Implementation Summary:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive WebSocket endpoints for real-time streaming with AutoGen integration.

**Key Components Implemented:**

1. **WebSocket Handler (`src/swarm_director/web/websocket.py`)** - 529 lines
   - Complete WebSocket event handling (connect, disconnect, start_stream, stop_stream, pause_stream, resume_stream)
   - Session management with client-to-session mapping
   - Real-time token streaming with latency tracking
   - Error handling and graceful degradation
   - Room-based messaging for targeted communication

2. **Flask-SocketIO Integration:**
   - Added Flask-SocketIO==5.3.6 to requirements.txt
   - Integrated SocketIO with Flask application factory pattern
   - Automatic fallback to regular Flask if WebSocket initialization fails
   - Proper extension management and cleanup

3. **HTTP Management Endpoints:**
   - `/api/websocket/status` - Get WebSocket server status and metrics
   - `/api/websocket/sessions` - List active WebSocket sessions
   - `/api/websocket/broadcast` - Broadcast messages to all connected clients

4. **WebSocket Test Interface:**
   - Created comprehensive test page at `/websocket-test`
   - Real-time connection status monitoring
   - Interactive streaming controls (start, pause, resume, stop)
   - Live metrics display (tokens received, latency, session status)
   - Event logging with timestamps

5. **Application Integration:**
   - Modified `run.py` to detect and use SocketIO when available
   - Added streaming initialization in `app.py`
   - Graceful handling of WebSocket service unavailability
   - Proper extension storage and reference management

**Technical Features:**
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Complete WebSocket event handling with proper error management
- **Session Management:** Client-to-session mapping with automatic cleanup on disconnect
- **Real-Time Streaming:** Token-by-token streaming with metadata and timestamp tracking
- **Backpressure Handling:** Integration with streaming manager's backpressure controls
- **Room-Based Messaging:** Targeted communication using SocketIO rooms
- **Metrics Collection:** Real-time latency tracking and performance monitoring
- **Error Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

**Testing & Verification:**
- All 237 existing tests continue to pass
- WebSocket functionality verified through test interface
- Proper integration with existing Flask application
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Usage:**
- Start server: WebSocket endpoint available at `ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/`
- Test interface: `http://localhost:5000/websocket-test`
- Status monitoring: `http://localhost:5000/api/websocket/status`

The WebSocket endpoints are now fully functional and ready for real-time AutoGen response streaming with comprehensive monitoring and control capabilities.
