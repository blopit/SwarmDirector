# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Database Schema and Models
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the SQLite database schema for storing agent logs, task metadata, and draft versions.
# Details:
1. Create SQLAlchemy models for:
   - Task (id, type, user_id, status, created_at, updated_at)
   - AgentLog (id, task_id, agent_type, message, timestamp)
   - Draft (id, task_id, version, content, created_at)
   - EmailMessage (id, task_id, recipient, subject, body, status, sent_at)
2. Define relationships between models
3. Implement database indices for performance optimization
4. Create database utility functions for common operations
5. Add database migration script for initial schema
6. Implement data access layer for CRUD operations
7. Add support for future PostgreSQL migration

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each model's CRUD operations
2. Verify relationships between models work correctly
3. Test database migrations apply successfully
4. Validate constraints and indices are properly created
5. Benchmark basic query performance
6. Test data integrity during concurrent operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Model Definition Phase [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define all data entities and their attributes in the database schema
### Details:
Create data models by identifying entities, defining attributes for each entity, establishing primary keys, and determining data types and constraints. This phase focuses on the conceptual and logical design of individual data structures without yet considering their relationships.

SUBTASK 2.1 MODEL DEFINITION PHASE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY âœ…

**Implementation Results:**

ðŸŽ¯ **Core Models Created (as per task requirements):**
âœ… **Task Model** - Enhanced with required fields:
   - âœ… id, type, user_id, status, created_at, updated_at (all required fields implemented)
   - âœ… Added TaskType enum for type categorization
   - âœ… Extended with comprehensive task management features

âœ… **AgentLog Model** - New model for agent activity tracking:
   - âœ… id, task_id, agent_type, message, timestamp (all required fields implemented)
   - âœ… Added LogLevel enum and additional metadata fields
   - âœ… Relationship with Task and Agent models
   - âœ… Convenience methods for logging agent activities

âœ… **Draft Model** - New model for document draft versions:
   - âœ… id, task_id, version, content, created_at (all required fields implemented)
   - âœ… Added DraftStatus and DraftType enums
   - âœ… Version management and approval workflow features
   - âœ… Author/reviewer tracking with agent relationships

âœ… **EmailMessage Model** - New model for email communications:
   - âœ… id, task_id, recipient, subject, body, status, sent_at (all required fields implemented)
   - âœ… Added EmailStatus and EmailPriority enums
   - âœ… Comprehensive email tracking and delivery management
   - âœ… Integration with Draft model for email content

ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**
- âœ… All models inherit from BaseModel with automatic timestamps
- âœ… Proper enum definitions for all status and type fields
- âœ… Foreign key relationships defined (ready for Phase 2)
- âœ… Comprehensive to_dict() methods for JSON serialization
- âœ… Business logic methods for common operations
- âœ… Updated models/__init__.py with all new model exports

**Status: All required data entities defined with proper attributes, primary keys, data types, and constraints. Ready for relationship configuration phase.**

## 2. Relationship Configuration Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Establish connections between defined models through foreign keys and relationship types
### Details:
Configure relationships between entities by defining foreign keys, establishing cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), implementing join tables where necessary, and ensuring referential integrity constraints are properly defined.

## 3. Database Utility Development Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Develop database management utilities for migration, optimization, and maintenance
### Details:
Create database migration scripts, implement indexing strategies for performance optimization, develop backup and recovery procedures, and build query optimization utilities to ensure efficient database operations and maintenance.

Database utility development phase has been completed with the following achievements:

- **Core Database Manager**: Implemented table management (create, drop, recreate), full database backup and restore with metadata, performance optimization (VACUUM, ANALYZE, SQLite pragma), comprehensive indexing strategy for all models, database statistics and health monitoring, integrity checks (including foreign key constraint verification), automated log cleanup, and query optimization suggestions.
- **Migration System**: Established schema versioning with version control, migration operations (apply, rollback, migrate to specific versions), migration generation from SQL files or interactive input, initial schema generation from existing database, and comprehensive migration status reporting.
- **CLI Interface**: Developed commands for database management (init, recreate, backup, restore, optimize, stats, integrity, cleanup) and migration management (status, upgrade, rollback, create, init-schema), including a standalone script for independent database management.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all core database manager functionality (backup/restore, optimization, indexing), tested full migration lifecycle (creation, application, rollback), conducted performance tests with large datasets (100 agents, 500 tasks, 1000 logs), and validated automated log cleanup.
- **Technical Achievements**: Ensured SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility, proper connection management with context managers, comprehensive error handling and logging, correct handling of Flask instance paths for database files, and implemented 20+ strategic indexes for optimal query performance.
- **Test Results**: All database utility tests passed (9/9 for database manager, 6/6 for migration manager, 5/5 for performance monitoring).

The database utility development phase is now complete, providing full functionality for migration management, performance optimization, backup/restore, and comprehensive maintenance capabilities. Ready to proceed to the next phase of development.
