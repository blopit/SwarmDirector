      "description": "Design and implement a simple, modern chat window UI for users to interact with the SwarmDirector AI agent system, supporting message/task submission, real-time feedback via streaming, and message history.",
      "details": "Develop a clean, modern chat interface that allows users to send messages or tasks to the DirectorAgent and receive responses in real time. The UI should include the following features:\n\n1. **Message Input Area:** A text input field for users to compose and send messages/tasks.\n2. **Message History Panel:** A scrollable area displaying the conversation history, including both user messages and agent responses.\n3. **Real-Time Streaming Feedback:** Integration with the AutoGen streaming interface to display agent responses as they are generated, providing immediate feedback.\n4. **Modern Design:** Use a minimalist, visually appealing layout with clear message bubbles, timestamps, and user/agent indicators.\n5. **Responsive Layout:** Ensure the UI works well on both desktop and mobile devices.\n6. **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages for failed submissions or connection issues.\n7. **Message Status Indicators:** Show loading or typing indicators while waiting for agent responses.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n- Use a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) for the chat window.\n- Connect to the Task API Endpoint (Task 8) for submitting user messages/tasks.\n- Integrate with the AutoGen Streaming Interface (Task 10) for real-time feedback.\n- Store and display message history using the existing database schema (Task 2), if required for persistence.\n- Ensure the UI is accessible and follows modern design best practices[2][4][5].\n\n**Code Example (React):**\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport './ChatWindow.css';\n\nfunction ChatWindow() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n  const [input, setInput] = useState('');\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSend = async () => {\n    if (!input.trim()) return;\n    const userMsg = { text: input, sender: 'user', timestamp: new Date() };\n    setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMsg]);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n    // Call Task API Endpoint (Task 8) and Streaming Interface (Task 10)\n    // ...\n    setInput('');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"chat-window\">\n      <div className=\"message-history\">\n        {messages.map((msg, idx) => (\n          <div key={idx} className={`message ${msg.sender}`}>\n            <span className=\"sender\">{msg.sender}</span>\n            <span className=\"text\">{msg.text}</span>\n            <span className=\"timestamp\">{msg.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString()}</span>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n        {isLoading && <div className=\"loading-indicator\">Agent is typing...</div>}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"input-area\">\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          value={input}\n          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}\n          onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleSend()}\n          placeholder=\"Type your message...\"\n        />\n        <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
      "testStrategy": "1. **UI Rendering:** Verify that the chat window renders correctly, displaying message history and input area.\n2. **Message Submission:** Test sending messages/tasks and confirm they appear in the message history.\n3. **Real-Time Feedback:** Ensure agent responses are displayed in real time as they are streamed.\n4. **Error Handling:** Test error scenarios (e.g., network failure, invalid input) and confirm appropriate user feedback.\n5. **Responsiveness:** Check the UI on different screen sizes and devices.\n6. **Accessibility:** Validate keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast.\n7. **Integration:** Confirm successful integration with the Task API Endpoint and AutoGen Streaming Interface.",
