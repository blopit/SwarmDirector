# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Database Migration Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop database migration support to facilitate future transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
# Details:
1. Create migration module in utils/migration.py
2. Implement Alembic integration for migrations
3. Create database abstraction layer
4. Add schema version tracking
5. Implement migration scripts
6. Create data migration utilities
7. Add validation for schema integrity
8. Implement rollback capabilities
9. Create documentation for migration process
10. Add testing framework for migrations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test migration scripts with sample data
2. Verify schema integrity after migrations
3. Test rollback functionality
4. Validate data preservation during migrations
5. Test PostgreSQL compatibility
6. Verify version tracking accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Alembic Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure Alembic for database schema migrations
### Details:
Install Alembic, create migration environment, configure connection to the database, and establish initial migration script structure. Ensure proper integration with the existing application architecture to support automated schema changes.

## 2. Develop Schema Version Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a robust system to track database schema versions
### Details:
Implement a version control mechanism that records schema changes, maintains history of migrations, and provides ability to identify current database state. Include functionality to validate schema consistency and detect drift between expected and actual schemas.

## 3. Build Data Migration Utility Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Develop utilities to handle data preservation and transformation during migrations
### Details:
Create reusable components for data transformation, validation, and preservation during schema changes. Include rollback capabilities, zero-downtime migration support, and compatibility layers to facilitate future transition to PostgreSQL.
