# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop CommunicationsDept Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the CommunicationsDept agent that extends AutoGen's ChatAgent to manage message drafting workflows.
# Details:
1. Create CommunicationsDept class in agents/communications.py
2. Extend AutoGen's ChatAgent class
3. Implement run method to handle incoming tasks
4. Add logic to spawn DraftReviewAgent instances via MultiAgentChain
5. Implement draft creation functionality
6. Create methods for merging critiques from review agents
7. Add reconciliation logic for conflicting suggestions
8. Implement final draft generation
9. Add logging for each step of the process
10. Create utility methods for communications-specific operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test draft creation with various inputs
2. Test parallel execution of review agents
3. Verify critique merging logic with conflicting inputs
4. Validate final draft generation
5. Test error handling during the drafting process
6. Benchmark performance with multiple concurrent requests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Communication Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundation of the CommunicationsDept agent with essential messaging and connection handling capabilities
### Details:
Create the core agent implementation including: 1) Message queue management for incoming/outgoing communications, 2) Connection handling between client and server agents, 3) Reply tracking with hash tables for message routing, 4) Logging facilities for operation status information, and 5) Threading support for non-blocking communication

## 2. Design Agent Orchestration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the architecture for managing multiple review agents and their interactions
### Details:
Develop the orchestration system that includes: 1) Hierarchical organization of agent teams, 2) Isolated state management for individual review agents, 3) Controlled communication protocols between agents, 4) Decision-making module for processing agent inputs, and 5) Memory module for storing past interactions and patterns

## 3. Implement Feedback Reconciliation Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create a system to analyze, compare and reconcile potentially conflicting feedback from multiple review agents
### Details:
Build the reconciliation component with: 1) Conflict detection algorithms to identify contradictory feedback, 2) Resolution strategies based on agent priority or consensus mechanisms, 3) Learning module to improve reconciliation over time, 4) Communication interface for explaining reconciliation decisions, and 5) Integration with the core agent to implement final reconciled actions
