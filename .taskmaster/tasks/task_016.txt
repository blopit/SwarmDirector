# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Chat Window UI for SwarmDirector AI Agent System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a simple, modern chat window UI for users to interact with the SwarmDirector AI agent system, supporting message/task submission, real-time feedback via streaming, and message history.
# Details:
Develop a clean, modern chat interface that allows users to send messages or tasks to the DirectorAgent and receive responses in real time. The UI should include the following features:

1. **Message Input Area:** A text input field for users to compose and send messages/tasks.
2. **Message History Panel:** A scrollable area displaying the conversation history, including both user messages and agent responses.
3. **Real-Time Streaming Feedback:** Integration with the AutoGen streaming interface to display agent responses as they are generated, providing immediate feedback.
4. **Modern Design:** Use a minimalist, visually appealing layout with clear message bubbles, timestamps, and user/agent indicators.
5. **Responsive Layout:** Ensure the UI works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
6. **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages for failed submissions or connection issues.
7. **Message Status Indicators:** Show loading or typing indicators while waiting for agent responses.

**Technical Approach:**
- Use a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) for the chat window.
- Connect to the Task API Endpoint (Task 8) for submitting user messages/tasks.
- Integrate with the AutoGen Streaming Interface (Task 10) for real-time feedback.
- Store and display message history using the existing database schema (Task 2), if required for persistence.
- Ensure the UI is accessible and follows modern design best practices[2][4][5].

**Code Example (React):**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './ChatWindow.css';

function ChatWindow() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleSend = async () => {
    if (!input.trim()) return;
    const userMsg = { text: input, sender: 'user', timestamp: new Date() };
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMsg]);
    setIsLoading(true);
    // Call Task API Endpoint (Task 8) and Streaming Interface (Task 10)
    // ...
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="chat-window">
      <div className="message-history">
        {messages.map((msg, idx) => (
          <div key={idx} className={`message ${msg.sender}`}>
            <span className="sender">{msg.sender}</span>
            <span className="text">{msg.text}</span>
            <span className="timestamp">{msg.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString()}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
        {isLoading && <div className="loading-indicator">Agent is typing...</div>}
      </div>
      <div className="input-area">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleSend()}
          placeholder="Type your message..."
        />
        <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. **UI Rendering:** Verify that the chat window renders correctly, displaying message history and input area.
2. **Message Submission:** Test sending messages/tasks and confirm they appear in the message history.
3. **Real-Time Feedback:** Ensure agent responses are displayed in real time as they are streamed.
4. **Error Handling:** Test error scenarios (e.g., network failure, invalid input) and confirm appropriate user feedback.
5. **Responsiveness:** Check the UI on different screen sizes and devices.
6. **Accessibility:** Validate keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast.
7. **Integration:** Confirm successful integration with the Task API Endpoint and AutoGen Streaming Interface.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Message Threading UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the visual components for message threading, including thread indicators, navigation controls, and context preservation elements.
### Details:
Design UI components that support message threading functionality, including indentation levels, reply counts, and profile image displays for thread participants. Create visual elements for quote replies and threaded responses. Implement navigation controls for moving between parent messages and thread views, with options for split-screen mode and thread expansion/collapse. Ensure the design preserves conversation context by grouping related messages while maintaining chronological order.

## 2. Implement Message Input and History Panel [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop the core chat interface components: a text input field for message composition and a scrollable history panel displaying the conversation.
### Details:
Create a clean, modern text input area with send button functionality. Implement a scrollable message history panel that displays both user messages and agent responses with clear visual distinction between them. Add message bubbles with appropriate styling, timestamps, and sender indicators. Ensure the history panel automatically scrolls to the newest messages and supports manual scrolling through conversation history.

## 3. Integrate Real-Time Streaming Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Connect the chat UI to the AutoGen streaming interface to display agent responses as they are generated in real-time.
### Details:
Implement the connection between the chat UI and the AutoGen streaming interface. Create visual indicators for when the agent is typing or processing a request. Develop the functionality to append incoming streamed text to the current response message in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users. Handle stream interruptions and reconnection gracefully.

## 4. Develop Responsive Layout and Cross-Device Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Ensure the chat UI works well across different screen sizes and devices with a responsive design approach.
### Details:
Implement responsive CSS using flexbox or grid layouts to adapt the chat interface to different screen sizes. Create breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Optimize touch interactions for mobile users while maintaining keyboard accessibility for desktop users. Ensure the message input area and history panel adjust appropriately to available screen space without compromising usability.

## 5. Implement Error Handling and Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Add user-friendly error messages and status indicators to provide feedback on message submission and connection status.
### Details:
Create visual indicators for message status (sent, delivered, failed). Implement user-friendly error messages for failed submissions or connection issues. Add loading or typing indicators while waiting for agent responses. Develop retry mechanisms for failed message submissions. Ensure all status changes are clearly communicated to users through appropriate visual cues.
