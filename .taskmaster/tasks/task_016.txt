# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Chat Window UI for SwarmDirector AI Agent System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a simple, modern chat window UI for users to interact with the SwarmDirector AI agent system, supporting message/task submission, real-time feedback via streaming, message history, and full transparency features. The UI must provide a seamless, responsive, and accessible experience, including activity logging, agent handoff notifications, and comprehensive status indicators.
# Details:
The chat interface is now functionally complete and includes the following features:

1. **Message Input Area:** Users can compose and send messages/tasks via a clean text input field with send button.
2. **Message History Panel:** A scrollable, threaded conversation view with message bubbles, timestamps, sender/agent indicators, and support for message threading and context preservation.
3. **Real-Time Streaming Feedback:** Integrated with Socket.IO for real-time WebSocket communication, providing immediate feedback as agent responses are generated.
4. **Transparency Features:** Includes a real-time activity log panel displaying all system operations, categorized system events, agent handoff notifications, and current agent display.
5. **Status Indicators:** Visual feedback for connection status, agent routing, processing state, and animated progress indicators for asynchronous tasks.
6. **Modern, Responsive Design:** Built with Alpine.js for reactive state management and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Layout adapts to desktop and mobile devices, maintaining usability and accessibility.
7. **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for failed submissions or connection issues, with retry mechanisms and clear status cues.
8. **Testing Infrastructure:** Playwright installed for E2E testing, npm package.json for frontend dependencies, and test directory structure prepared.

**Technical Approach:**
- Main chat window UI implemented in `src/swarm_director/web/templates/chat.html`.
- Served via Flask route `/chat` in `src/swarm_director/app.py`.
- Socket.IO used for real-time backend integration.
- Activity log and transparency features fully integrated.
- Playwright E2E test coverage planned for all UI flows and state transitions.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete Playwright test configuration and comprehensive test suite.
- Test all UI interactions, WebSocket connections, and transparency features.
- Validate agent handoff visualizations and activity logging.
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance.

# Test Strategy:
1. **UI Rendering:** Confirm the chat window renders correctly, displaying threaded message history, input area, and activity log.
2. **Message Submission:** Test sending messages/tasks and verify appearance in message history and activity log.
3. **Real-Time Feedback:** Ensure agent responses and system events are displayed in real time via WebSocket streaming.
4. **Transparency Features:** Validate activity log accuracy, agent handoff notifications, and status indicators for all system operations.
5. **Error Handling:** Simulate error scenarios (network failure, invalid input) and confirm user-friendly feedback and retry options.
6. **Responsiveness:** Check UI on various screen sizes and devices for layout and usability.
7. **Accessibility:** Validate keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast.
8. **Integration:** Confirm seamless operation with Flask backend, Socket.IO, and all transparency features.
9. **E2E Testing:** Use Playwright to automate and verify all critical UI flows, state transitions, and transparency mechanisms.
