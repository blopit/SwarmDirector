# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create End-to-End Demo and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive demo and documentation for the prototype system to showcase the complete workflow.
# Details:
1. Create demo script showcasing key features
2. Implement sample client application
3. Create documentation for API usage
4. Add installation and setup guide
5. Create architecture diagrams
6. Implement interactive demo UI
7. Add performance benchmarks
8. Create troubleshooting guide
9. Implement sample configurations
10. Add future roadmap documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test demo with various scenarios
2. Verify documentation accuracy
3. Test installation process on different environments
4. Validate API examples work correctly
5. Test interactive demo functionality
6. Verify troubleshooting guide addresses common issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Interactive Demo Application [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a functional demo application that showcases key features with personalized, realistic data and visual storytelling elements
### Details:
Implement solution-selling approach in the demo, use realistic data that resonates with target users, incorporate visual storytelling elements, ensure the demo is interactive to encourage user engagement, and test thoroughly before deployment to identify and fix any technical issues

## Implementation Progress Update - Step 4: Implementation Continuation

**Current Status Assessment:**
✅ Demo application backend (`examples/demo_app.py`) - Complete
✅ Main demo landing page (`src/swarm_director/web/templates/demo/index.html`) - Complete  
⚠️ Scenario template (`src/swarm_director/web/templates/demo/scenario.html`) - Missing

**Key Findings:**
- Existing demo app has 3 well-designed business scenarios (customer support, marketing, data insights)
- Frontend uses modern tech stack: Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Chart.js for interactivity
- Demo routes are properly configured with realistic mock data
- Main template has hero section, metrics display, scenario cards, features section

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1. Create the missing scenario.html template for individual scenario interactions  
2. Ensure proper integration with existing Flask routes
3. Test the complete demo workflow end-to-end
4. Verify all interactive elements work correctly

**Technical Approach:**
- Build scenario template with task execution simulation
- Include real-time progress tracking UI
- Add interactive elements for task triggering
- Maintain consistent styling with index.html
