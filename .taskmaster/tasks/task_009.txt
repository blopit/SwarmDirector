## Initial Analysis and Implementation Plan

### Current State Analysis (2025-06-17 13:49 EDT)

I've analyzed the existing codebase and identified the current agent structure:

**Existing Components:**
1. **BaseAgent** (`base_agent.py`): Abstract base class with basic agent functionality
2. **DirectorAgent** (`director.py`): Main orchestrator with routing logic and intent classification
3. **CommunicationsDept** (`communications_dept.py`): Manages message drafting workflows
4. **EmailAgent** (`email_agent.py`): Handles email composition and SMTP delivery
5. **DraftReviewAgent**: For reviewing content drafts
6. **SupervisorAgent**: Base class for department agents

**Gaps Identified for Agent Integration Framework:**
1. **Missing Workflow Orchestrator**: No centralized system to manage end-to-end workflows
2. **No State Management**: Agents operate independently without shared context
3. **Limited Inter-Agent Communication**: No standardized messaging framework
4. **No Transaction Management**: No way to rollback failed workflows
5. **No Event-Driven Architecture**: Agents aren't notified of state changes
6. **Missing Service Registry**: No central registry for agent discovery
