# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement End-to-End Email Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate all components to create the complete workflow from DirectorAgent through CommunicationsDept to EmailAgent.
# Details:
1. Connect DirectorAgent to CommunicationsDept
2. Integrate CommunicationsDept with DraftReviewAgents
3. Connect CommunicationsDept to EmailAgent
4. Implement workflow state tracking
5. Add transaction management for database operations
6. Create error recovery mechanisms
7. Implement logging throughout the workflow
8. Add performance monitoring
9. Create utility functions for workflow management
10. Implement workflow visualization for debugging

# Test Strategy:
1. Test complete workflow with various inputs
2. Verify correct state transitions
3. Test error recovery in different scenarios
4. Validate transaction integrity during failures
5. Benchmark end-to-end performance
6. Test concurrent workflow execution

# Subtasks:
## 1. Agent Integration Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a framework for integrating multiple AI agents into a cohesive workflow system
### Details:
Create a modular architecture that enables seamless communication between different agent components. Define clear interfaces for agent interaction, implement service-oriented architecture principles, and establish event-driven communication channels for agent collaboration. Include mechanisms for agent discovery, registration, and dynamic role assignment within the workflow.

## 2. State Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement a robust state management system to maintain context across workflow steps
### Details:
Design a state management system that tracks the progress of ongoing processes, maintains context across interactions, and ensures consistency throughout the workflow. Define possible states and transitions, create mechanisms for updating states based on events or actions, and implement methods for propagating state changes to relevant components. Include support for global workflow context that tools and functions can access.

## 3. Error Recovery Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive error handling and recovery processes for workflow resilience
### Details:
Create error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms to handle failures at different levels of the workflow. Implement transaction management to ensure data consistency during failures, design retry strategies for transient errors, and develop fallback mechanisms for critical operations. Include the ability to roll back to previous states when errors occur and provide clear error reporting for troubleshooting.

## 4. Performance Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Build a monitoring system to track workflow performance and identify optimization opportunities
### Details:
Implement metrics collection for workflow execution times, resource utilization, and success rates. Create dashboards for visualizing performance data, set up alerting for performance degradation, and develop tools for identifying bottlenecks. Include capabilities for A/B testing different workflow configurations and provide recommendations for workflow optimization based on performance data analysis.
