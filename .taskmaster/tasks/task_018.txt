# Subtasks:
## 4. Standardize Naming Conventions and Templates [done]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Develop and document consistent naming conventions and standardized templates for tasks and workflows within SwarmDirector.
### Details:
Define naming rules and create template files for common task types and workflow processes. Ensure templates are easy to use and adapt.
<info added on 2025-06-13T18:32:08.272Z>
To align workflow processes and automation integration effectively, it is crucial to address the missing components identified in the SwarmDirector Task Management System. This includes implementing a Task Management UI Dashboard, Task Templates System, Progress Visualization, Task Analytics, Advanced Workflows, User Management Interface, Notifications System, Search & Filter Capabilities, Task Scheduling, and Bulk Operations. 

For template standardization, create task creation templates for different TaskTypes (e.g., EMAIL, COMMUNICATION, ANALYSIS) and establish standardized API response templates and UI component templates. Implement consistent naming patterns for UI components, API responses, frontend assets, and task-related files and directories. 

Prioritize these implementations based on their impact and foundational needs, starting with the Task Management UI Dashboard and Task Templates System. Ensure that all templates are easy to use and adapt for various workflow processes.

1. **Establish .taskmaster/ Directory Structure:** Implement a structured 6-directory system under .taskmaster/ to organize all task-related assets, following internal best practices for clarity and security. This structure should group assets by function and access needs, prioritizing simplicity and ease of navigation[3][5].
2. **Create Centralized tasks.json Database:** Introduce a hierarchical tasks.json file as the master database for all tasks, enabling centralized tracking and management of task status, dependencies, and metadata.
3. **Implement Context Documentation System:** Develop a structured context documentation system using YAML frontmatter and Markdown files, ensuring all tasks have clear, searchable context and supporting documentation.
4. **Integrate MCP Tools:** Incorporate 25+ MCP tools for comprehensive task lifecycle management, automating key processes and improving workflow efficiency.
5. **Add AI-Powered Complexity Analysis:** Introduce AI-driven complexity scoring and automated recommendations to assist with task prioritization and resource allocation.
6. **Implement Dependency Tracking:** Establish formal dependency tracking and validation mechanisms to ensure task dependencies are clearly defined and managed.
7. **Create Template Standardization:** Develop and enforce standardized templates for tasks, PRDs, and workflows, reducing variability and improving documentation quality.
8. **Document Workflow Processes:** Formalize and document the 7-step development workflow, providing clear guidance for all team members and ensuring consistent process execution.

These recommendations are prioritized according to criticality and should be implemented in the order listed to maximize impact and alignment with internal standards.
