# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Recovery
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop robust error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the system to ensure resilience.
# Details:
1. Create error handling module in utils/error_handling.py
2. Implement global exception handler
3. Add retry logic for transient failures
4. Create circuit breaker pattern implementation
5. Implement graceful degradation strategies
6. Add transaction rollback mechanisms
7. Create error classification system
8. Implement custom error types
9. Add context preservation during errors
10. Create utility functions for error recovery

# Test Strategy:
1. Test error handling with various exception types
2. Verify retry logic works correctly
3. Test circuit breaker under failure conditions
4. Validate transaction rollback integrity
5. Test graceful degradation scenarios
6. Verify context preservation during recovery

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Global Exception Handler [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized exception handling mechanism using IExceptionHandler in ASP.NET Core 8 or equivalent in your framework
### Details:
Develop a GlobalExceptionHandler class that implements IExceptionHandler interface, configure logging for exceptions, and implement ProblemDetails responses for different exception types. This will provide consistent error responses across the application.

IMPLEMENTATION ALREADY COMPLETE âœ… - Global Exception Handler Successfully Implemented

Analysis Results:
The global exception handling system is already comprehensively implemented and integrated into the SwarmDirector application.

Current Implementation Details:

1. ErrorHandler Class (utils/error_handler.py):
   - Centralized error handling with Flask integration
   - init_app() method for Flask application factory pattern
   - Comprehensive error handler registration for different exception types
   - Standardized error response formatting via ResponseFormatter
   - Context-aware logging with request details and correlation IDs
   - Severity-based logging (critical, error, warning, info)

2. Custom Exception Hierarchy:
   - SwarmDirectorError: Base exception with error codes, status codes, details, correlation IDs
   - ValidationError: Input validation failures with field-specific details
   - AuthenticationError: Authentication/authorization failures
   - ResourceNotFoundError: Resource not found with type/ID context
   - RateLimitError: Rate limiting with retry-after headers
   - DatabaseError: Database operation failures

3. Flask Integration (app.py):
   - register_error_handlers() function called during app initialization
   - Error handler properly registered in app.extensions
   - Global error handling active across all routes
   - Integration with response formatting system

4. Error Response Features:
   - Standardized JSON error responses
   - HTTP status code mapping
   - Correlation ID tracking for debugging
   - Detailed error context preservation
   - Request metadata capture (method, URL, IP, user-agent)
   - Timestamp tracking

5. Decorator Support:
   - @require_error_handling decorator for function-level error wrapping
   - Automatic conversion of unexpected exceptions to SwarmDirectorError
   - Traceback logging for debugging

The global exception handler provides consistent error responses across the entire application and is already active and functional.

## 2. Implement Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop retry mechanisms and circuit breakers to handle transient failures
### Details:
Implement retry policies with exponential backoff for transient errors, create circuit breaker components to prevent cascading failures, and configure appropriate timeout settings for external service calls.
<info added on 2025-06-18T15:59:49.144Z>
Implementation is fully complete and verified. No further action required for this subtask. Marking as done.

## 3. Implement Transaction Management [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create transaction management components for maintaining data consistency during errors
### Details:
Develop transaction scope handlers, implement compensating transactions for rollback scenarios, and create mechanisms to ensure data consistency across distributed systems when errors occur.
<info added on 2025-06-18T16:01:31.472Z>
Transaction management and rollback mechanisms are fully implemented and operational across all relevant components. No further action is required for this subtask. Marking as complete.
