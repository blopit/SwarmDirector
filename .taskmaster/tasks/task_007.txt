# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop EmailAgent with SMTP Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the EmailAgent as a ToolAgent that interfaces with Flask-Mail to send emails via SMTP.
# Details:
1. Create EmailAgent class in agents/email.py
2. Configure as AutoGen ToolAgent
3. Integrate with Flask-Mail extension
4. Implement send_email method to dispatch messages
5. Add parsing logic for recipient, subject, and body fields
6. Create email validation functions
7. Implement error handling for SMTP failures
8. Add logging for email operations
9. Create utility functions for email formatting
10. Implement status tracking for sent emails

# Test Strategy:
1. Test email sending with mock SMTP server
2. Verify correct parsing of email components
3. Validate error handling for various SMTP failures
4. Test email validation functions
5. Verify logging of email operations
6. Test status tracking for sent emails

# Subtasks:
## 1. ToolAgent Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the ToolAgent architecture for the email agent using LangGraph
### Details:
Configure the ToolAgent component that will handle email operations. Define the agent's role, capabilities, and interaction patterns with other components in the system. Implement the necessary LangGraph structures for agent communication and decision-making processes.

âœ… ITERATION 1 COMPLETE - ToolAgent Architecture Implementation

Successfully refactored EmailAgent to AutoGenToolAgent:

- Migrated agent inheritance to AutoGenToolAgent with email-specific configuration and low temperature for deterministic behavior.
- Implemented a tool registration system with five core email tools: send_email, compose_email, validate_email, get_email_templates, and add_email_template.
- Developed tool functions for SMTP sending, template-based composition, and validation, each returning structured results.
- Preserved backward compatibility: retained execute_task(), Flask-Mail integration, and EmailMessage database model.
- Enhanced system message to document agent capabilities, tool availability, and operational guidelines.

Next Steps:
- Test tool function integration and agent creation.
- Verify agent interaction and ensure Flask-Mail functionality is preserved.

ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED!

Final Testing Results:
- EmailAgent now inherits from AutoGenToolAgent as intended
- All five core email tools (send_email, compose_email, validate_email, get_email_templates, add_email_template) are registered and callable
- System message is configured with comprehensive, email-specific instructions
- Backward compatibility is fully maintained, including execute_task and can_handle_task methods
- AutoGen configuration (temperature=0.3, max_tokens=1500) is active and verified

Key Accomplishments:
1. Completed migration from WorkerAgent to AutoGenToolAgent architecture
2. Established a robust tool registration framework for core email operations
3. Integrated AutoGen UserProxyAgent with a tailored system message for email workflows
4. Preserved and integrated all Flask-Mail and SMTP functionality
5. Ensured compatibility with existing Task-based workflows
6. Improved error handling with tool-specific responses

Technical Implementation Details:
- System message details all agent capabilities and tool usage
- Tools are registered with accurate function references and parameter documentation
- Low temperature setting ensures consistent, deterministic email operations
- Database integration is preserved via the optional db_agent parameter
- All original email templates and validation logic remain intact

The EmailAgent is now fully configured as an AutoGen ToolAgent, ready for multi-agent interactions and maintaining all legacy functionality.

## 2. Flask-Mail Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Integrate Flask-Mail extension with the email agent architecture
### Details:
Implement the Flask-Mail integration to handle SMTP operations. Configure email servers, authentication methods, and message formatting. Create the necessary interfaces between the ToolAgent and Flask-Mail to enable seamless email sending and receiving capabilities.

ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Flask-Mail Integration Assessment

Key Findings:
- Flask-Mail is fully integrated and operational, with SMTP configuration set up in app.py and config.py.
- The EmailAgent._send_via_flask_mail() method is functional and includes proper error handling.
- The Mail extension is initialized within the app context in create_app().
- Email message creation and sending are implemented, supporting both plain text and template-based emails.
- Flask-Mail==0.9.1 is specified in requirements.txt, and the Mail extension is initialized with mail = Mail() and mail.init_app(app).
- SMTP configuration leverages environment variables for flexibility.
- The system includes error handling for missing MAIL_SERVER configuration, defaulting to simulation mode if necessary.
- The template system is operational for email composition.

Enhancement Opportunities:
- Add support for HTML emails in addition to plain text.
- Improve handling of SMTP authentication methods.
- Implement connection pooling to enhance performance.
- Enhance retry logic for failed email sends.
- Integrate email tracking and delivery status monitoring.

Next Steps:
Proceed to implement the identified enhancements while maintaining current functionality.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Flask-Mail Integration Enhanced

âœ… COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Enhanced _send_via_flask_mail Method:
   - Added HTML email support with html_body parameter
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts by default)
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
   - Added proper email headers (X-Mailer, X-Priority, Reply-To)
   - Uses existing mail extension from app.extensions for better performance

2. Updated send_email_tool Method:
   - Added html_body parameter to tool function signature
   - Enhanced return data includes has_html indicator
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   - Updated tool registration to document HTML support

3. Tool Registration Enhanced:
   - Updated available_tools dictionary to include html_body parameter
   - Added proper parameter documentation for HTML support
   - All existing tools maintained for compatibility

4. Backward Compatibility Maintained:
