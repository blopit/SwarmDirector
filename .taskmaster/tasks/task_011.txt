# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Logging and Monitoring System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track agent activities, errors, and performance metrics.
# Details:
1. Create logging module in utils/logging.py
2. Implement structured logging format
3. Add database logging for agent activities
4. Create performance metric collection
5. Implement log rotation and archiving
6. Add error aggregation and reporting
7. Create dashboard for log visualization
8. Implement log search functionality
9. Add alerting for critical errors
10. Create utility functions for common logging operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test logging with various event types
2. Verify log rotation works correctly
3. Test performance metric collection accuracy
4. Validate error reporting functionality
5. Test log search with different queries
6. Verify alerting triggers correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Structured Logging Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a structured logging system with consistent format and relevant contextual information
### Details:
Select a structured logging library that integrates with your web framework. Establish a consistent format (e.g., JSON) across the application. Include essential fields like timestamps, log levels, and context-specific data. Implement proper log levels (info, warning, error, debug). Add unique identifiers to log entries for better searchability. Test locally to ensure logs are generated correctly in the expected format.

Installed structlog for structured JSON logging and psutil for system metrics collection to enhance the existing logging system. Updated the plan to integrate structlog with the current logging setup, ensuring backward compatibility, and began modifying logging.py to support structured, context-rich logs. Dependency installation completed as the first implementation step.

Implementation completed successfully:

- Enhanced logging.py with structured JSON logging using structlog, ensuring all log entries include timestamps, correlation IDs, and rich contextual data.
- Integrated thread-safe correlation ID tracking via thread-local storage for improved traceability across requests.
- Implemented automatic performance metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, process stats) using psutil, with metrics included in log output.
- Added a performance timing decorator to track function execution times.
- Enabled log rotation (10MB files, 5 backups) for robust log management.
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility with existing logging calls.
- Developed comprehensive unit tests (3 test classes, all passing) and verified integration with the live system.
- Updated requirements.txt with structlog>=23.1.0 and psutil>=5.9.0.
- Created detailed documentation in docs/development/logging.md.
- Validation: All unit and integration tests pass, JSON log output is correct, system metrics collection is functional, and correlation ID tracking works as intended.

Ready to proceed to the next subtask: Develop Performance Metric Collection System (11.2).

## 2. Develop Performance Metric Collection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a system to collect and process application performance metrics
### Details:
Identify key performance indicators to track. Implement metric collection for system resources (CPU, memory, disk). Add application-specific metrics (response times, throughput, error rates). Correlate metrics with structured logs using unique identifiers. Ensure minimal performance impact from the collection process. Test the metric collection system to validate data accuracy and completeness.

## 3. Build Visualization and Alerting Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Develop dashboards and alerting mechanisms for log analysis and performance monitoring
### Details:
Integrate structured logs and performance metrics with visualization tools. Create customized dashboards for different stakeholders. Implement filtering and search capabilities for log analysis. Set up alerting thresholds for critical metrics and log patterns. Configure notification channels (email, Slack, etc.). Test the entire system in staging environment before production deployment.
