# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Concurrent Request Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the system to handle at least 10 concurrent requests during prototype demos without significant slowdown.
# Details:
1. Implement asynchronous request processing
2. Add thread pool for parallel execution
3. Create connection pooling for database access
4. Implement request queuing mechanism
5. Add load balancing for agent distribution
6. Create resource monitoring system
7. Implement adaptive throttling
8. Add performance profiling
9. Create utility functions for concurrency management
10. Implement timeout handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark system with varying concurrent loads
2. Test resource utilization under load
3. Verify response times remain under 500ms
4. Test queue behavior during peak loads
5. Validate throttling effectiveness
6. Verify timeout handling works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Asynchronous Processing Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the asynchronous processing mechanism to handle concurrent operations without blocking
### Details:
Utilize the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) for fine-grained parallelism. Implement task objects that distribute independent operations across computing resources. Ensure proper synchronization primitives that use cooperative blocking to synchronize access to resources.

## 2. Develop Connection Pooling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create an efficient connection pooling mechanism to manage and reuse connections
### Details:
Design a three-layered architecture that restricts concurrency control to a single layer to avoid nested monitor problems. Implement thread-safe connection management with efficient resource allocation and deallocation strategies. Consider shared memory issues and ensure proper synchronization.

## 3. Implement Request Queuing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Build a request queuing system to manage incoming requests during high load periods
### Details:
Develop a blackboard architecture for request management. Implement execution coordination mechanisms using semaphores and mutexes to control access to the queue. Create process groups to handle different aspects of request processing and ensure proper interprocess communication.

## 4. Create Adaptive Throttling Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Develop an adaptive throttling system that dynamically adjusts processing based on system load
### Details:
Implement a Resource Manager component that monitors system resources and adjusts concurrency levels accordingly. Design algorithms for dynamic scaling based on current load patterns. Integrate with the request queuing system to provide feedback mechanisms for load balancing and preventing system overload.
