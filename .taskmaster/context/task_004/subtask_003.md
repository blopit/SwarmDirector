# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Implement GroupChat or GroupChatManager for coordinating dialogue flow between agents

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_004 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_004
- **Dependencies**: ['task_004/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Implement GroupChat or GroupChatManager for coordinating dialogue flow between agents
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture
