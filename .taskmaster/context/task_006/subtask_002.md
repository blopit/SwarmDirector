# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create a specialized component for generating structured JSON diffs between drafts

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_006 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Develop JSON Diff Generation Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_006
- **Dependencies**: ['task_006/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Create a specialized component for generating structured JSON diffs between drafts
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Build a DiffGenerator class that takes two versions of content and produces a structured JSON representation of their differences. Implement algorithms to detect additions, deletions, modifications, and moves within the content. Ensure the diff format is consistent and includes metadata such as change types, locations, and severity levels. This component should be reusable across different review contexts.
