# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop a separate module for quantitative assessment of draft quality

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_006 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Implement Quality Scoring Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_006
- **Dependencies**: ['task_006/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop a separate module for quantitative assessment of draft quality
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Create a QualityScorer class that evaluates drafts against predefined criteria and generates numerical scores. Implement scoring algorithms for various quality dimensions (clarity, coherence, grammar, etc.). Include methods for score normalization, aggregation, and comparison between drafts. Design the component to be configurable with different scoring rubrics and thresholds depending on the context.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_006.txt`
- Parent Task: task_006
