# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create a separate module for handling the core review logic of the DraftReviewAgent

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_006 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Implement Review Logic Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_006
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Create a separate module for handling the core review logic of the DraftReviewAgent
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Develop a dedicated ReviewLogic class that encapsulates the draft analysis functionality. This component should handle parsing input drafts, identifying key elements to review, and generating textual feedback. Include methods for different types of reviews (content, structure, style) and ensure the component can work independently of the other parts of the system.
