# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop comprehensive technical documentation covering architecture, implementation details, and integration guidelines

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_015 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Create Technical Documentation
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_015
- **Dependencies**: ['task_015/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop comprehensive technical documentation covering architecture, implementation details, and integration guidelines
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

---

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Document secure and scalable architecture decisions, include code complexity explanations, detail CI/CD implementation, create staging and production environment specifications, and incorporate feedback from development team reviews to ensure accuracy and completeness

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_015.txt`
- Parent Task: task_015

---

## 🛠️ 6. Implementation Plan
Document secure and scalable architecture decisions, include code complexity explanations, detail CI/CD implementation, create staging and production environment specifications, and incorporate feedback from development team reviews to ensure accuracy and completeness

---

## 🧪 7. Testing & QA
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration**: Verify integration with parent task
- **Edge Cases**: Handle error conditions
- **Manual Verification**: Confirm functionality works as expected

---

## 🔗 8. Integration & Related Tasks
- **Parent**: task_015 (Create End-to-End Demo and Documentation)
