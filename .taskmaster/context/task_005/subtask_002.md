# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create the architecture for managing multiple review agents and their interactions

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_005 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Design Agent Orchestration System
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_005
- **Dependencies**: ['task_005/subtask_001']
