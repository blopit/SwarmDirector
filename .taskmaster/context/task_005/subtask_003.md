# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create a system to analyze, compare and reconcile potentially conflicting feedback from multiple review agents

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_005 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Implement Feedback Reconciliation Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_005
- **Dependencies**: ['task_005/subtask_001', 'task_005/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Create a system to analyze, compare and reconcile potentially conflicting feedback from multiple review agents
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Build the reconciliation component with: 1) Conflict detection algorithms to identify contradictory feedback, 2) Resolution strategies based on agent priority or consensus mechanisms, 3) Learning module to improve reconciliation over time, 4) Communication interface for explaining reconciliation decisions, and 5) Integration with the core agent to implement final reconciled actions

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_005.txt`
- Parent Task: task_005
