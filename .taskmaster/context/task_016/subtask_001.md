# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create the visual components for message threading, including thread indicators, navigation controls, and context preservation elements.

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_016 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Design Message Threading UI Components
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_016

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Design UI components that support message threading functionality, including indentation levels, reply counts, and profile image displays for thread participants. Create visual elements for quote replies and threaded responses. Implement navigation controls for moving between parent messages and thread views, with options for split-screen mode and thread expansion/collapse. Ensure the design preserves conversation context by grouping related messages while maintaining chronological order.
