# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop an adaptive throttling system that dynamically adjusts processing based on system load

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_013 / subtask_004
- **Title**: Create Adaptive Throttling Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_013
- **Dependencies**: ['task_013/subtask_001', 'task_013/subtask_003']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop an adaptive throttling system that dynamically adjusts processing based on system load
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Implement a Resource Manager component that monitors system resources and adjusts concurrency levels accordingly. Design algorithms for dynamic scaling based on current load patterns. Integrate with the request queuing system to provide feedback mechanisms for load balancing and preventing system overload.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_013.txt`
- Parent Task: task_013
