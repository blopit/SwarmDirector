# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create an efficient connection pooling mechanism to manage and reuse connections

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_013 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Develop Connection Pooling System
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_013
- **Dependencies**: ['task_013/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Create an efficient connection pooling mechanism to manage and reuse connections
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Design a three-layered architecture that restricts concurrency control to a single layer to avoid nested monitor problems. Implement thread-safe connection management with efficient resource allocation and deallocation strategies. Consider shared memory issues and ensure proper synchronization.
