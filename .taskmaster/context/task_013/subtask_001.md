# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop the asynchronous processing mechanism to handle concurrent operations without blocking

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_013 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Implement Asynchronous Processing Component
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_013
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop the asynchronous processing mechanism to handle concurrent operations without blocking
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

---

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Utilize the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) for fine-grained parallelism. Implement task objects that distribute independent operations across computing resources. Ensure proper synchronization primitives that use cooperative blocking to synchronize access to resources.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_013.txt`
- Parent Task: task_013
