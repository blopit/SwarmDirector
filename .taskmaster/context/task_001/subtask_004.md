# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Implement the routes and templates for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_001 / subtask_004
- **Title**: CRUD Operations Implementation
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_001
- **Dependencies**: ['task_001/subtask_003']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Implement the routes and templates for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture
