# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop dashboards and alerting mechanisms for log analysis and performance monitoring

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_011 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Build Visualization and Alerting Components
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_011
- **Dependencies**: ['task_011/subtask_001', 'task_011/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop dashboards and alerting mechanisms for log analysis and performance monitoring
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Integrate structured logs and performance metrics with visualization tools. Create customized dashboards for different stakeholders. Implement filtering and search capabilities for log analysis. Set up alerting thresholds for critical metrics and log patterns. Configure notification channels (email, Slack, etc.). Test the entire system in staging environment before production deployment.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_011.txt`
- Parent Task: task_011
