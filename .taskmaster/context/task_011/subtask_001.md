# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Set up a structured logging system with consistent format and relevant contextual information

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_011 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Implement Structured Logging Framework
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_011
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Set up a structured logging system with consistent format and relevant contextual information
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Select a structured logging library that integrates with your web framework. Establish a consistent format (e.g., JSON) across the application. Include essential fields like timestamps, log levels, and context-specific data. Implement proper log levels (info, warning, error, debug). Add unique identifiers to log entries for better searchability. Test locally to ensure logs are generated correctly in the expected format.
