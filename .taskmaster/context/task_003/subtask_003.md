# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Create the routing framework that directs tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on intent classification

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_003 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Implement Routing Logic and Agent Communication
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_003
- **Dependencies**: ['task_003/subtask_001', 'task_003/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Create the routing framework that directs tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on intent classification
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Develop the routing decision tree that maps classified intents to specific agent capabilities. Implement the inter-agent communication protocol for standardized messaging. Create the parallel execution framework allowing multiple specialist agents to work simultaneously. Build the aggregation system for synthesizing results from multiple agents. Include error handling and fallback mechanisms for routing failures.
