# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop both keyword-based and LLM-based classification systems for accurately determining user intent

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_003 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Build Intent Classification System
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_003
- **Dependencies**: ['task_003/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop both keyword-based and LLM-based classification systems for accurately determining user intent

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Implement a dual-layer intent classification system combining keyword matching for efficiency and LLM-based classification for nuanced understanding. Create training datasets for intent categories. Develop confidence scoring mechanisms to determine when to escalate from keyword to LLM classification. Include feedback loops for continuous improvement of classification accuracy based on interaction outcomes.
