# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Implement the foundational Director Agent architecture with hierarchical control structures and decision-making capabilities

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_003 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Develop Core Director Agent Framework
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_003
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Implement the foundational Director Agent architecture with hierarchical control structures and decision-making capabilities
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Create the base Director Agent class with supervisor capabilities for task decomposition and delegation. Implement the core decision-making cycle that evaluates evidence, updates beliefs, and selects actions to maximize utility. Include the structured utility network with preference nodes for narrative/task objectives. Establish the monitoring system for tracking subtask progress and agent state.

## 🔧 3. Interfaces & Code Snippets
### 3.1 DirectorAgent Base Class
```python
class DirectorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()
        self.utility_network = UtilityNetwork()
        self.active_subtasks = {}

    def decompose_task(self, task):
        subtasks = self.decision_engine.analyze_and_decompose(task)
        return self.delegate_subtasks(subtasks)
```

### 3.2 Decision-Making Cycle
```python
def decision_cycle(self, evidence):
    beliefs = self.update_beliefs(evidence)
    actions = self.evaluate_actions(beliefs)
    return self.select_optimal_action(actions)
```
