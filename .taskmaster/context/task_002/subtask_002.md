# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Establish connections between defined models through foreign keys and relationship types

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_002 / subtask_002
- **Title**: Relationship Configuration Phase
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_002
- **Dependencies**: ['task_002/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Establish connections between defined models through foreign keys and relationship types
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Configure relationships between entities by defining foreign keys, establishing cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), implementing join tables where necessary, and ensuring referential integrity constraints are properly defined.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_002.txt`
- Parent Task: task_002
