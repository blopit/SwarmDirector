# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop database management utilities for migration, optimization, and maintenance

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_002 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Database Utility Development Phase
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_002
- **Dependencies**: ['task_002/subtask_001', 'task_002/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop database management utilities for migration, optimization, and maintenance
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture
