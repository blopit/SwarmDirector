# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Define all data entities and their attributes in the database schema

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_002 / subtask_001
- **Title**: Model Definition Phase
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Parent Task**: task_002
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Define all data entities and their attributes in the database schema
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture
