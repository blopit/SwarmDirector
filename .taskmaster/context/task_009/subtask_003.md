# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Develop comprehensive error handling and recovery processes for workflow resilience

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_009 / subtask_003
- **Title**: Error Recovery Mechanism
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_009
- **Dependencies**: ['task_009/subtask_001', 'task_009/subtask_002']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Develop comprehensive error handling and recovery processes for workflow resilience
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Create error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms to handle failures at different levels of the workflow. Implement transaction management to ensure data consistency during failures, design retry strategies for transient errors, and develop fallback mechanisms for critical operations. Include the ability to roll back to previous states when errors occur and provide clear error reporting for troubleshooting.

## 📁 2. Reference Artifacts & Files
- File: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_009.txt`
- Parent Task: task_009
