# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Implement a robust state management system to maintain context across workflow steps

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_009 / subtask_002
- **Title**: State Management System
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_009
- **Dependencies**: ['task_009/subtask_001']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Implement a robust state management system to maintain context across workflow steps
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture

## 🔍 1. Detailed Description
Design a state management system that tracks the progress of ongoing processes, maintains context across interactions, and ensures consistency throughout the workflow. Define possible states and transitions, create mechanisms for updating states based on events or actions, and implement methods for propagating state changes to relevant components. Include support for global workflow context that tools and functions can access.
