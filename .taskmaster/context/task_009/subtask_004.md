# 🎯 Subtask Overview
Build a monitoring system to track workflow performance and identify optimization opportunities

## 📋 Metadata
- **ID**: task_009 / subtask_004
- **Title**: Performance Monitoring System
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Parent Task**: task_009
- **Dependencies**: ['task_009/subtask_001', 'task_009/subtask_002', 'task_009/subtask_003']
- **Created / Updated**: 2025-06-10

## 🗒️ Scope, Assumptions & Constraints
- **In Scope**: Build a monitoring system to track workflow performance and identify optimization opportunities
- **Out of Scope**: Features handled by other subtasks
- **Assumptions**: Dependencies completed, required tools available
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with parent task architecture
