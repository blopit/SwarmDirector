# Environment File Restriction Rule

## Forbidden Actions
- **Never create .env files** using any file creation tools
- **Never edit existing .env files** using edit tools
- **Never modify environment variables** directly in files

## Required Process
- **Create tasks in tasks/human** when environment configuration is needed
- **Document exactly what needs to be changed** in the task
- **Explain why the change is necessary** for the user to understand
- **Provide the exact values** that should be set

## Task Creation Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive task titles
- Include step-by-step instructions
- List all required environment variables
- Explain the impact of each variable
- Reference related configuration files

## Examples
```markdown
# ✅ DO: Create human task
Create task: "Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in .env file"

# ❌ DON'T: Edit directly
edit_file(".env", "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=...")
```

## Security Reasons
- Environment files contain sensitive data
- Direct editing bypasses security reviews
- Human oversight prevents accidental exposure
- Maintains audit trail of configuration changes
