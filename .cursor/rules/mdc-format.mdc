# MDC File Format Guidelines

## File Structure
- Start with YAML frontmatter containing description and globs
- Use clear hierarchical headings with ## for sections
- Include examples where appropriate
- End file with newline

## Format Requirements
- No brackets or quotes around glob patterns
- Keep description concise but clear
- Use bullet points for readability
- Format code examples with backticks
- Keep content organized in logical sections

## File Creation Process
1. Create file using cat or echo commands
2. Set permissions with chmod 644
3. Verify content with cat
4. Never use edit_file tool for .mdc files

## Content Guidelines
- One rule concept per file
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Include examples of correct/incorrect usage
- Document any exceptions or special cases
- Keep rules focused and specific

## Validation
- Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
- Check glob patterns are valid
- Ensure all sections are properly formatted
- Test rule application scenarios
