# MDC File Validator

## Required Fields
- Every MDC file MUST have a filled description field
- Every MDC file MUST have either globs pattern or alwaysApply set to true
- Description should be concise but descriptive
- If file applies to specific file types, use globs
- If file should apply to all operations, use alwaysApply: true

## Glob Pattern Format
- NEVER use brackets around glob patterns
- NEVER use quotes around glob patterns
- Correct: `globs: path/to/*.extension`
- Incorrect: `globs: [path/to/*.extension]`
- Incorrect: `globs: "path/to/*.extension"`
- Brackets or quotes will cause the rule to be invalid

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] description field is present and not empty
- [ ] either globs pattern exists or alwaysApply: true is set
- [ ] globs pattern has NO brackets or quotes
- [ ] file has proper permissions (chmod 644)
- [ ] content follows MDC format guidelines
- [ ] file ends with a blank newline

## Implementation
- Always check these requirements when creating or editing MDC files
- Use chmod 644 before and after editing to ensure proper permissions
- Verify all required fields are filled before considering the rule complete
- Run `find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" -size 1c` to check for corrupted files
