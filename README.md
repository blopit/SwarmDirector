   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python -c "
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
   from swarm_director.app import create_app
   from swarm_director.models.base import db
   app = create_app()
   with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()
       print('Database initialized successfully')
   "
   ```

5. **Run the application**
